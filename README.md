# gulshan-library
A front-end for a site created as part of a contest. It was designed as a website for an online library that would deliver books that the customer would check out.

## Background
This website was created for the Aptech Vision Contest. The website had to serve as a demo for what the final, complete website would look like. The user would create an account and select a membership plan. They could then login and borrow a certain number of books from the library's catalogue, and these would then be delivered to the user's address. The idea was to provide a library that could function during COVID lockdowns.

## Site Design
Since there was no server back-end for the site, several JS based workarounds had to be implemented to give the impression of a back-end. For example, the user could login through a pre-defined username and password to access the logged-in version of the pages. The cart functionality was implemented via an array that would be persistent across different pages. The site uses Ken Wheeler's Slick carousel v.1.8.1, but the files for it are not included here.
